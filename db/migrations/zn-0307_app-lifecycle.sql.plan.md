# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0307_app-lifecycle.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0307_app-lifecycle.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-052](../../docs/specs/spec-052.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0307](../../docs/tickets/zn-0307.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-052
ValidateMiniApp(definition,baseRelease) -> ValidatedManifest|Errors; InstantiateAppTemplate(template,parameters) -> DefinitionChange|InstanceAction; PublishApp(change) -> existing release process; OpenView(session,bindings) -> SemanticCalls through SPEC-050.

MiniAppDefinition closes over appId, pages, approved component registry versions, query/action bindings, form schemas, requested capabilities, resource budget and accessibility labels. It is immutable release content. AppPublicationBinding(appId, manifestDigest, mode, optional artifactDigest, runtimeProfileRef) belongs to the released graph. Drafts remain existing builder_drafts; no mutable runtime latest alias is authority.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
