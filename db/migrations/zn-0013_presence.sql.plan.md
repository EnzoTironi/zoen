# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0013_presence.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0013_presence.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-002](../../docs/specs/spec-002.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0013](../../docs/tickets/zn-0013.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-002
DoorPort.verify(assertion) -> PresenceProof; CreatePersonalWorld(operationId, seedDigest) -> GenesisReceipt; OpenWorld(worldId,purpose) -> GrantRef | Denied; AcceptInvitation(invitationToken,operationId) -> MembershipReceipt.

door.subject_map(subject_id PK, principal_id UNIQUE); ontology.worlds(world_id PK, realm, cell_id, epoch, release_digest, generation_id, security_revision, status); ontology.memberships(world_id,principal_id PK, role, status, revision); ontology.grants(grant_hash PK, world_id, principal_id, purpose, audience_hash, assurance, expires_at, security_revision, scope_json); ontology.invitations(invitation_hash PK, world_id, intended_subject, expires_at, consumed_by). Owner runtime role differs from migration owner.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
