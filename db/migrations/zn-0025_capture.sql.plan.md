# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0025_capture.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0025_capture.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-004](../../docs/specs/spec-004.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0025](../../docs/tickets/zn-0025.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-004
StageCapture(binding,stream,declaredMetadata) -> CaptureRef | Quarantined; AdmitCapture(captureRef,mappingDigest,operationId) -> AdmissionReceipt; ReadEvidence(evidenceRef,grant) -> AuthorizedStream | HistoricalContentUnavailable.

ontology.source_bindings(binding_id PK,world_id,definition_id,state,credential_ref,acl_revision); ontology.captures(capture_id PK,world_id,binding_id,source_namespace,external_id,revision,blob_ref,digest,acquired_at,state,UNIQUE(world_id,binding_id,external_id,revision,digest)); ontology.evidence(evidence_id PK,world_id,capture_id,rights_ref,validity_json,retention_ref,admission_commit); ontology.source_admissions(binding_id,capture_id,mapping_digest PK,receipt_id). Object keys are opaque World/realm-scoped; object digests are internal.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
