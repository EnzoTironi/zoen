# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0170_artifact-build.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0170_artifact-build.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-029](../../docs/specs/spec-029.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0170](../../docs/tickets/zn-0170.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-029
ProposeArtifact(envelope,bytesRef) -> Candidate; EvaluateArtifact(candidate,EvaluationWorld) -> Proof; InstallArtifact(digest,requestedGrant,operationId) -> Change; RecallArtifact(digest) -> RecallReceipt.

ontology.artifacts(artifact_digest PK,kind,runtime_abi,entrypoint,sbom_ref,provenance_ref,signature_ref,capability_request,resource_profile); ontology.installations(installation_id PK,world_id,artifact_digest,granted_scope,release_ref,state); ontology.artifact_recalls(recall_id PK,digest,reason,effective_at,scope); ontology.artifact_evaluations(evaluation_id PK,digest,profile,report_ref,state). Blobs are retained under controlled object-store policy.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
