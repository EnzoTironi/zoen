# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0118_watch-contract.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0118_watch-contract.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-020](../../docs/specs/spec-020.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0118](../../docs/tickets/zn-0118.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-020
CreateWatch(definition,scope,operationId) -> Watch; EvaluateWatch(watch,commitEnvelope) -> Checkpoint | Notice; DecideAttention(noticeRef,relationship) -> Deliver | Merge | Defer | Silence; PauseWatch/ResumeWatch/CancelWatch -> Receipt.

ontology.watches(watch_id PK,world_id,definition_digest,subject_scope,state,checkpoint_cut,materiality_state); ontology.notices(notice_id PK,watch_id,transition_identity,basis_ref,state,UNIQUE(watch_id,transition_identity)); eve.attention(notice_id,relationship_id PK,state,reason,not_before,merge_group,last_checked_rights); ontology.subscriptions(subscription_id PK,world_id,plan_digest,cursor,state).

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
