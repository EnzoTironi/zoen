# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0044_discovery.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0044_discovery.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-007](../../docs/specs/spec-007.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0044](../../docs/tickets/zn-0044.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-007
Inspect(operationId,input,purpose,expectedContract) -> WorldFrame; Explain(frameId,grant) -> Frame; OpenFrame(frameId,freshGrant) -> SameHistoricalFrame | NewerFrame | HistoricalContentUnavailable; Discover(grant) -> AllowedOperationManifest.

ontology.frames(frame_id PK,world_id,head_digest,cut_json,operation_id,plan_digest,perspective,rights_basis,payload_ref,created_at,expires_at); ontology.frame_pins(frame_id,evidence_or_snapshot_ref PK,retention_class). Opaque Focus records live in Eve, not here. Index frames by World and ID; no global public digest endpoint.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
