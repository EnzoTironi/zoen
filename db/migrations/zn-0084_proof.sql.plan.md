# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0084_proof.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0084_proof.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-014](../../docs/specs/spec-014.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0084](../../docs/tickets/zn-0084.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-014
ProposeDefinitionChange(base,patch,operationId) -> Change; EvaluateChange(change) -> ReleaseProof; PrepareActivation(change,world) -> PreparedActivation; ApproveChange(change,digest) -> Approval; ActivateRelease(proof,preparation,approval,operationId) -> ActivationReceipt | PreparationStale.

ontology.changes(change_id PK,world_id,base_release,candidate_release,risk,state,author,version); ontology.release_proofs(proof_id PK,release_digest,kernel_image,evaluation_world,cut_digest,report_ref,missing_attestations); ontology.preparations(preparation_id PK,world_id,expected_head,target_release,target_generation,through_cut,open_work_disposition,state); ontology.release_approvals(change_id,principal_id,case_digest PK,policy_basis); ontology.activations(receipt_id PK,world_id,old_head,new_head,proof_ref,preparation_ref). Evaluation namespaces and credentials are separate.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
