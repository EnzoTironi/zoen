# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0199_distributed-contract.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0199_distributed-contract.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-034](../../docs/specs/spec-034.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0199](../../docs/tickets/zn-0199.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-034
ExecuteVirtualRead(plan,lease) -> CapturedResult | ReferenceOnlyResult; SubmitCompute(profile,artifact,inputs,budget) -> Run; ObserveCompute(run) -> State; AdmitComputeOutput(run) -> AnalysisOrDatasetProposal.

jobs.compute_runs(run_id PK,world_id,engine_profile,input_cut,artifact_digest,budget_ref,state,output_ref,usage); ontology.virtual_reads(read_id PK,world_id,source_binding,query_digest,external_snapshot_ref,observed_at,coverage,rights_ref,capture_ref_nullable). Engine configuration and scale parameters are versioned runtime data under an admitted adapter ABI.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
