# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0053_model-attempt.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0053_model-attempt.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-009](../../docs/specs/spec-009.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0053](../../docs/tickets/zn-0053.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-009
AcceptTurn(ingressRef) -> TurnRef; AdvanceTurn(turnId,expectedVersion,fence,event) -> TurnState | LostLease; SettleVisibleMessage(turnId,attemptId,content) -> MessageRef; CancelTurn(turnId) -> CancellationState.

eve.conversations(conversation_id PK,relationship_id,world_ref_nullable,audience_ref,version); eve.turns(turn_id PK,conversation_id,ingress_id UNIQUE,state,version,lease_owner,fence,lease_until,release_digest); eve.attempts(attempt_id PK,turn_id,kind,intent_digest,output_ref,status,usage_json); eve.messages(message_id PK,turn_id,revision,state,visible_text,evidence_refs,UNIQUE(turn_id,revision)); eve.focus(focus_id PK,relationship_id,world_ref,subject_ref,frame_ref,lens,temporal_intent). No authority credentials in Eve tables.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
