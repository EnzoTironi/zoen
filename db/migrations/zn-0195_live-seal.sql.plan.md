# File plan — `db/migrations/zn-0195_live-seal.sql`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `db/migrations/zn-0195_live-seal.sql`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-033](../../docs/specs/spec-033.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0195](../../docs/tickets/zn-0195.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL MIGRATION PLAN — never feed this Markdown to a migrator.
IF no durable invariant is introduced by the owning ticket: do not create a no-op SQL migration.
OTHERWISE acquire the global schema lock; inspect existing catalog and table owner before adding DDL.
DECLARE explicit types, primary/unique keys, World+realm composite foreign references and indexes.
SEPARATE migrator DDL from runtime roles; parameterize values and retain source/rights/retention lineage.
ORDER expand → backfill → validate → contract, with restartable bounded backfill.
TEST empty database, prior-schema upgrade, role denials, crash boundary and forward repair using real PostgreSQL.
ASSIGN final monotonic migration number only when the genuine SQL is reviewed; never pre-record a planned migration as applied.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-033
SubscribeLive(binding,subjects,grant) -> EntitledSubscription; ObserveFeed(envelope) -> TransientState; CaptureObservation(binding,sequence,maxAge,operationId) -> CapturedObservationRef | SourceStale; SealFeedRange(range) -> DatasetProposal.

live feed transport is non-authoritative and bounded; ontology.feed_bindings(binding_id PK,world_id,provider,feed_contract,entitlement_ref); ontology.live_captures(capture_id PK,world_id,binding_id,provider_sequence,event_time,acquired_at,digest,evidence_ref,rights_ref); ontology.feed_gaps(gap_id PK,binding_id,sequence_range,state). Sealed history publishes through normal datasets.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
