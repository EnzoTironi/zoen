# File plan — `packages/kernel/src/graph.ts`

**Status:** candidate-unaccepted; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `packages/kernel/src/graph.ts`. Representation: **existing-with-sidecar**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-001](../../../docs/specs/spec-001.md).
Tickets: Existing candidate support; ticket ownership is in the spec, not implied acceptance..

## Responsibility and reuse

The adjacent implementation is preserved. Read it first, extend it in place, and prove behavior at the ticket's required layer. Do not replace it with this plan or create a duplicate primitive.

```text
CONDITIONAL SUPPORT SEGMENT.
FIRST prove this file is needed by an owning ticket; do not implement parallel abstractions merely to fill paths.
READ the current implementation and shared module algorithm; select only the missing support responsibility.
KEEP dependency direction and single authority ownership; no provider success stub or ambient credential.
WIRE into the owning ticket's declared entry and prove its exact tests.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-001
parseEnvelope(bytes) -> ValidEnvelope | InvalidInput; normalizeDecimal(text, scalePolicy) -> Decimal | InvalidScalar; compareIntervals(a,b) -> ComparableInterval | NonComparable; canonicalDigest(value) -> sha256.

No tables. Normative JSON schemas live under contracts/kernel. IDs are opaque UUID values tagged at runtime with world/realm; counters and monetary values cross JSON as decimal strings. Database identifiers must not be guessable credentials.

[algorithm SPEC-001](../../../docs/algorithms/spec-001.md)

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
