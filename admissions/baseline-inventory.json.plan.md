# File plan — `admissions/baseline-inventory.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `admissions/baseline-inventory.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-000](../docs/specs/spec-000.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0001](../docs/tickets/zn-0001.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
EVIDENCE-REQUIRES-EXECUTION — deliberately no fabricated target artifact.
RUN the actual registry/package-manager/provider/infrastructure qualification for this ticket.
RECORD observed identities, exact versions/integrity, supported API/profile, commands and failed or blocked results.
REQUIRE independent approval and current expiry/scope where applicable.
ONLY produce a lock using the real package manager; only produce a certificate from actual evidence.
NEVER rename this plan into a passing report.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-000
AdmitExecutionProfile(profile, candidateVersions, integrityDigests, compatibilityReport) -> AdmittedLock | Blocked; VerifyTicket(ticketId, commit, profile) -> EvidenceReport | MissingPrerequisite.

No application tables. Track execution-lock.json, baseline-inventory.json and evidence-index.json as reviewed artifacts. Secret values never belong in these files.

[algorithm SPEC-000](../docs/algorithms/spec-000.md)

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
