# File plan — `admissions/spec-002/extension-lock.json`

**Status:** implementation-in-progress; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `admissions/spec-002/extension-lock.json`. Representation: **existing-with-sidecar**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-002](../../docs/specs/spec-002.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0013](../../docs/tickets/zn-0013.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

The adjacent implementation is preserved. Read it first, extend it in place, and prove behavior at the ticket's required layer. Do not replace it with this plan or create a duplicate primitive.

```text
EVIDENCE-REQUIRES-EXECUTION — deliberately no fabricated target artifact.
RUN the actual registry/package-manager/provider/infrastructure qualification for this ticket.
RECORD observed identities, exact versions/integrity, supported API/profile, commands and failed or blocked results.
REQUIRE independent approval and current expiry/scope where applicable.
ONLY produce a lock using the real package manager; only produce a certificate from actual evidence.
NEVER rename this plan into a passing report.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-002
DoorPort.verify(assertion) -> PresenceProof; CreatePersonalWorld(operationId, seedDigest) -> GenesisReceipt; OpenWorld(worldId,purpose) -> GrantRef | Denied; AcceptInvitation(invitationToken,operationId) -> MembershipReceipt.

door.subject_map(subject_id PK, principal_id UNIQUE); ontology.worlds(world_id PK, realm, cell_id, epoch, release_digest, generation_id, security_revision, status); ontology.memberships(world_id,principal_id PK, role, status, revision); ontology.grants(grant_hash PK, world_id, principal_id, purpose, audience_hash, assurance, expires_at, security_revision, scope_json); ontology.invitations(invitation_hash PK, world_id, intended_subject, expires_at, consumed_by). Owner runtime role differs from migration owner.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
