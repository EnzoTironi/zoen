# File plan — `admissions/spec-031/extension-lock.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `admissions/spec-031/extension-lock.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-031](../../docs/specs/spec-031.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0180](../../docs/tickets/zn-0180.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
EVIDENCE-REQUIRES-EXECUTION — deliberately no fabricated target artifact.
RUN the actual registry/package-manager/provider/infrastructure qualification for this ticket.
RECORD observed identities, exact versions/integrity, supported API/profile, commands and failed or blocked results.
REQUIRE independent approval and current expiry/scope where applicable.
ONLY produce a lock using the real package manager; only produce a certificate from actual evidence.
NEVER rename this plan into a passing report.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-031
StageDataset(run,inputs) -> StagedVersion; ValidateDataset(stage) -> QualityResult; PinDataset(stage,retention) -> PinProof; PublishDataset(versionSet,expectedBasis,operationId) -> PublicationReceipt; ReadDataset(versionRef,grant) -> ExactSnapshotReader.

ontology.dataset_versions(version_id PK,world_id,dataset_id,table_uuid,snapshot_id,metadata_location,metadata_digest,schema_digest,partition_spec,input_cut,lineage_ref,rights_label,quality_ref); ontology.dataset_pins(pin_id PK,version_id,artifact_set_digest,retention_until,state); ontology.dataset_publications(publication_id PK,world_id,version_refs,commit_id); jobs.dataset_stages(stage_id PK,run_id,table_branch,version_ref,state). Catalog uses a separate database.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
