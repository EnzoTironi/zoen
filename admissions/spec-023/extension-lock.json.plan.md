# File plan — `admissions/spec-023/extension-lock.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `admissions/spec-023/extension-lock.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-023](../../docs/specs/spec-023.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0135](../../docs/tickets/zn-0135.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
EVIDENCE-REQUIRES-EXECUTION — deliberately no fabricated target artifact.
RUN the actual registry/package-manager/provider/infrastructure qualification for this ticket.
RECORD observed identities, exact versions/integrity, supported API/profile, commands and failed or blocked results.
REQUIRE independent approval and current expiry/scope where applicable.
ONLY produce a lock using the real package manager; only produce a certificate from actual evidence.
NEVER rename this plan into a passing report.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
