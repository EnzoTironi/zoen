# File plan — `contracts/spec-033/live-capture.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-033/live-capture.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-033](../../docs/specs/spec-033.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0194](../../docs/tickets/zn-0194.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-033
SubscribeLive(binding,subjects,grant) -> EntitledSubscription; ObserveFeed(envelope) -> TransientState; CaptureObservation(binding,sequence,maxAge,operationId) -> CapturedObservationRef | SourceStale; SealFeedRange(range) -> DatasetProposal.

live feed transport is non-authoritative and bounded; ontology.feed_bindings(binding_id PK,world_id,provider,feed_contract,entitlement_ref); ontology.live_captures(capture_id PK,world_id,binding_id,provider_sequence,event_time,acquired_at,digest,evidence_ref,rights_ref); ontology.feed_gaps(gap_id PK,binding_id,sequence_range,state). Sealed history publishes through normal datasets.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
