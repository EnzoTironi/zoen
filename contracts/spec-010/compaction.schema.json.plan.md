# File plan — `contracts/spec-010/compaction.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-010/compaction.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-010](../../docs/specs/spec-010.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0059](../../docs/tickets/zn-0059.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-010
CompileContext(turn,grant,limits) -> ContextBundle | IncompleteBasis; SelectModel(requestPurpose,dataUse,region,budget) -> PermittedRoute | NoPermittedModel; ProposeTranscript(audioEvidence,languageHint) -> AttributedTranscript.

eve.context_snapshots(context_id PK,turn_id,release_digest,visible_message_refs,frame_refs,skill_ref,model_route_ref,purpose,budget_ref); eve.summaries(summary_id PK,conversation_id,through_message_id,text,model_ref,expires_at); eve.model_observations(attempt_id PK,provider,model,usage,output_ref,retention_ref). Raw hidden reasoning fields are excluded by schema.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
