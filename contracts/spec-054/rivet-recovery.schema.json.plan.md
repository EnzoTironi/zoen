# File plan — `contracts/spec-054/rivet-recovery.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-054/rivet-recovery.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-054](../../docs/specs/spec-054.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0318](../../docs/tickets/zn-0318.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-054
Zoen-owned port: PrepareRuntime(artifact,profile,realm) -> PreparedRuntime; ProbeRuntime(preparation) -> Attestation; ResolvePreparedRuntime(binding,session) -> IsolatedTarget; RetireRuntime(slot) -> Result. These are Zoen adapter contracts, not asserted Rivet API names.

jobs.app_runtime_preparations(preparation_id PK,world_id,realm,manifest_digest,artifact_digest,profile_digest,runtime_slot_ref,host_state_partition,attempt_fence,status,attestation_ref,expires_at); jobs.app_runtime_slots(slot_ref PK,immutable_identity,digest,runner_scope,state). Public AppPublicationBinding remains in the released Ontology graph. Runtime process globals/SQLite are not authoritative company data.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
