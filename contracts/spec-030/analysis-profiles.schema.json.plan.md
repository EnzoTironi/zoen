# File plan — `contracts/spec-030/analysis-profiles.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-030/analysis-profiles.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-030](../../docs/specs/spec-030.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0177](../../docs/tickets/zn-0177.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-030
AcquireExecutionLease(installation,inputRefs,scope) -> Lease; BrokerRead(lease,resource) -> BoundedInput; BrokerCall(lease,capability,args) -> Observation; RunAnalysis(lease,artifact) -> AnalysisArtifact | Failed | Unknown.

ontology.execution_leases(lease_id PK,world_id,artifact_digest,principal,purpose,allowed_ops,input_refs,budget_ref,expires_at,epoch,state); jobs.runner_attempts(attempt_id PK,lease_id,host_profile,fence,state,output_ref,usage); ontology.analysis_artifacts(analysis_id PK,world_id,code_digest,input_cut,seed_nullable,determinism,output_ref,lineage,rights_label).

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
