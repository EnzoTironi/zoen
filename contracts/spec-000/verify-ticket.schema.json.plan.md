# File plan — `contracts/spec-000/verify-ticket.schema.json`

**Status:** implementation-in-progress; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-000/verify-ticket.schema.json`. Representation: **existing-with-sidecar**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-000](../../docs/specs/spec-000.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0005](../../docs/tickets/zn-0005.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

The adjacent implementation is preserved. Read it first, extend it in place, and prove behavior at the ticket's required layer. Do not replace it with this plan or create a duplicate primitive.

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-000
AdmitExecutionProfile(profile, candidateVersions, integrityDigests, compatibilityReport) -> AdmittedLock | Blocked; VerifyTicket(ticketId, commit, profile) -> EvidenceReport | MissingPrerequisite.

No application tables. Track execution-lock.json, baseline-inventory.json and evidence-index.json as reviewed artifacts. Secret values never belong in these files.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
