# File plan — `contracts/spec-046/pretrade-risk.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-046/pretrade-risk.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-046](../../docs/specs/spec-046.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0270](../../docs/tickets/zn-0270.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-046
ValuePortfolio(portfolio,priceBasis,fxBasis,policy) -> ValuationFrame; EvaluateRisk(orderIntent,basis,limits) -> Pass|Fail|Unknown; InspectDepth(instrument,feedCut,grant) -> EntitledBook | Gapped; CaptureTradeBasis(ref,maxAge) -> EvidenceRef.

Released objects: Quote, Trade, OrderBookState, Position, CashBalance, Reservation, Portfolio, Benchmark, ValuationPolicy, RiskLimit and RiskObservation. Dense feeds use exact dataset/capture references; portfolio snapshots contain declared account coverage and adjustment/valuation policy.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
