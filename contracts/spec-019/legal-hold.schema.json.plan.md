# File plan — `contracts/spec-019/legal-hold.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-019/legal-hold.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-019](../../docs/specs/spec-019.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0115](../../docs/tickets/zn-0115.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-019
RequestErasure(scope) -> ReviewedCase; PlanErasure(case,basis) -> ArtifactClosure; ExecuteErasure(task,permit) -> DeletionReceipt; CheckRestoreSuppression(restoredCut,currentLedger) -> SuppressionPlan | Blocked.

ontology.retention_policies(policy_id PK,scope,purpose,expiry_rule,hold_rules,version); ontology.erasure_cases(case_id PK,scope,requested_by,state,decision_ref); ontology.erasure_tasks(task_id PK,case_id,artifact_ref,store,kind,state,receipt_ref); audit.deletion_ledger(sequence PK,scope_digest,artifact_ref,decision_ref,effective_at); ontology.holds(hold_id PK,scope,authority_evidence,expires_at,state). Deletion ledger durability is separate from a restored application backup.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
