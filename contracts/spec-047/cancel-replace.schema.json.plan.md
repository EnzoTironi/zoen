# File plan — `contracts/spec-047/cancel-replace.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-047/cancel-replace.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-047](../../docs/specs/spec-047.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0275](../../docs/tickets/zn-0275.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-047
ProposeOrder(intent,basis) -> RiskBoundActionCase; ObserveBrokerEvent(rawEvidence) -> OrderLifecycleReceipt; AllocateExecution(execution,accounts) -> AllocationCase; ObserveCustody(movementEvidence) -> SettlementReceipt; ReviewCollaboration(space,policy) -> SupervisedView.

Released objects: Order, OrderRevision, BrokerRequest, Execution, ExecutionCorrection, Allocation, ClearingObligation, CustodyMovement, SettlementObservation and SupervisedConversation. Stable provider/account/order/execution IDs are scoped; quantity and fee/currency conservation are checked in normal domain Actions.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
