# File plan — `contracts/spec-025/injection-containment.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-025/injection-containment.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-025](../../docs/specs/spec-025.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0150](../../docs/tickets/zn-0150.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-025
Search(query,grant,bounds) -> AuthorizedSearchFrame | UnsupportedPlan; RetrieveEvidence(resultRef,freshGrant) -> Evidence; StartSpecializedAgent(definition,parentMandate,task) -> BoundedAgentRun.

ontology.search_documents(document_id PK,world_id,evidence_ref,source_revision,projection_cut,rights_label,text_vector,embedding_ref); ontology.embedding_jobs(job_id PK,source_ref,model_profile,rights_basis,state); ontology.agent_definitions are released data, not unbounded executable loaders. Index records carry deletion/source ACL lineage.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
