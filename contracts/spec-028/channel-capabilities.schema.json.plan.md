# File plan — `contracts/spec-028/channel-capabilities.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-028/channel-capabilities.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-028](../../docs/specs/spec-028.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0167](../../docs/tickets/zn-0167.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-028
AdmitTelegramWebhook(raw,verification) -> Ingress; AdmitEmailWebhook(raw,verification) -> Ingress; LinkChannel(principalProof,challenge) -> Binding; ContinueConversation(focus,newChannel) -> FreshAuthorizedTurn.

Reuse channels.ingress, bindings, consent and delivery with provider/account namespaces. Email message/thread headers and Telegram chat IDs are provider-scoped references, not authenticated principals. A relationship-channel link requires separate proof and consent.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
