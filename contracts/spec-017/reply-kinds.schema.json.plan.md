# File plan — `contracts/spec-017/reply-kinds.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-017/reply-kinds.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-017](../../docs/specs/spec-017.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0103](../../docs/tickets/zn-0103.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-017
RankClarifications(scope,budget) -> QuestionQueue; AssignSteward(question,principal) -> Assignment; AnswerQuestion(question,digest,answerKind,payload,operationId) -> ScopedReceipt | RuleDraft | Stale.

ontology.clarifications(question_id PK,world_id,subject,predicate,scope_digest,candidate_digest,basis_ref,impact,deadline,state,steward_ref); ontology.stewardships(stewardship_id PK,world_id,scope,principal_ref,authority_kind,valid_interval); eve.question_delivery(question_id,relationship_id PK,attention_state,last_presented_digest). Deduplicate by world/subject/predicate/scope/candidate version.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
