# File plan — `contracts/spec-040/capacity-benchmark.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-040/capacity-benchmark.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-040](../../docs/specs/spec-040.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0235](../../docs/tickets/zn-0235.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-040
ReserveUsage(world,resource,estimate) -> Reservation | QuotaExceeded; AdmitWorkload(profile,benchmarkReport) -> CapacityCertificate; RequestSupportAccess(scope,purpose) -> TimeBoundCase; ExportAudit(scope,destination) -> AuthorizedArtifact.

ontology.quota_policies(policy_id PK,world_id,resource,limit,window,priority); jobs.usage_reservations(reservation_id PK,world_id,kind,estimate,actual,state); audit.support_sessions(session_id PK,operator,world_scope,purpose,approver,expires_at,state); audit.slo_reports(report_id PK,profile,workload_digest,window,metrics,evidence_ref). Billing ledger references provider entitlements, never raw card data.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
