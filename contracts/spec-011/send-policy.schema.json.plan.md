# File plan — `contracts/spec-011/send-policy.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-011/send-policy.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-011](../../docs/specs/spec-011.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0066](../../docs/tickets/zn-0066.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-011
AdmitWebhook(rawBytes,verifiedHeaders) -> DurableAck | Reject; BindChannel(proof,challenge) -> BindingReceipt; PrepareDelivery(messageRef,policyBasis) -> DeliveryIntent | Deferred | Denied; ObserveDelivery(providerEvidence) -> DeliveryObservation.

channels.ingress(ingress_id PK,provider,account_ref,provider_event_id,received_at,signature_profile,payload_ref,UNIQUE(provider,account_ref,provider_event_id)); channels.bindings(binding_id PK,provider_subject,principal_ref_nullable,consent_ref,assurance,state); channels.delivery(delivery_id PK,message_ref,destination_ref,provider_message_id,state,attempt_ref); channels.consent(consent_id PK,subject_ref,purpose,granted_at,revoked_at,evidence_ref). Provider payload retention is explicit.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
