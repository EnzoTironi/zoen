# File plan — `contracts/spec-044/self-hosted.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-044/self-hosted.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-044](../../docs/specs/spec-044.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0258](../../docs/tickets/zn-0258.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-044
IssueOfflineLease(scope,resourcePartition,expiry) -> ChildLease; RecordOfflineOperation(lease,intent) -> LocalReceipt | Denied; ReconcileChild(receipts) -> Admitted|Conflict|Expired; AdmitSelfHostedProfile(evidence) -> Profile; ProposeFleetUpdate(release) -> LocalChangeSet.

ontology.child_leases(lease_id PK,parent_world,child_scope,epoch,resource_partition,allowed_ops,expires_at,clock_uncertainty,max_offline,state); ontology.offline_receipts(receipt_id PK,child_scope,lease_ref,sequence,intent_digest,observed_basis,reconciled_state); control.fleet_profiles(profile_id PK,version,equivalence_evidence,policy_digest,state).

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
