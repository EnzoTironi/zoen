# File plan — `contracts/spec-039/dedicated-cell.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-039/dedicated-cell.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-039](../../docs/specs/spec-039.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0225](../../docs/tickets/zn-0225.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-039
ProvisionCell(profile,region,lock) -> StagedCell; AdmitCell(evidence) -> ActiveCell; RestoreCell(backup,ledger,profile) -> ReadOnlyCell; OpenPrivateConnector(profile) -> ScopedRoute.

Infrastructure state describes account/region/cell, authority database, object namespaces, KMS keys, private endpoints, workload identities, backup policy and admitted image digests. control.cells(cell_id PK,region,profile,epoch,admission_ref,state); audit.recovery_runs(run_id PK,cell_id,backup_ref,measured_rpo,measured_rto,evidence_ref). Customer content stays out of the directory/control plane.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
