# File plan — `contracts/spec-042/migration-stage.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-042/migration-stage.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-042](../../docs/specs/spec-042.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0246](../../docs/tickets/zn-0246.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-042
PrepareMove(world,destination) -> StagedReplica; FenceSource(world,epoch) -> FenceReceipt; PromoteWorld(fence,destinationProof,expectedDirectory) -> NewEpoch; AdmitBoot(world,cell,epoch) -> WriteAdmission | ReadOnly.

control.world_directory(world_id,realm PK,cell_id,epoch,region,state,version); control.promotions(promotion_id PK,world_id,source_epoch,target_epoch,source_fence_receipt,destination_proof,state); ontology.local_authority(world_id PK,installed_epoch,write_enabled,fence_receipt,boot_admission); jobs.migration_runs(run_id PK,world_id,source_cut,target_cut,validation_ref,state). Directory is a single-writer durable control store, not a grant database.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
