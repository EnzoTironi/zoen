# File plan — `contracts/spec-052/app-definition.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-052/app-definition.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-052](../../docs/specs/spec-052.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0302](../../docs/tickets/zn-0302.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-052
ValidateMiniApp(definition,baseRelease) -> ValidatedManifest|Errors; InstantiateAppTemplate(template,parameters) -> DefinitionChange|InstanceAction; PublishApp(change) -> existing release process; OpenView(session,bindings) -> SemanticCalls through SPEC-050.

MiniAppDefinition closes over appId, pages, approved component registry versions, query/action bindings, form schemas, requested capabilities, resource budget and accessibility labels. It is immutable release content. AppPublicationBinding(appId, manifestDigest, mode, optional artifactDigest, runtimeProfileRef) belongs to the released graph. Drafts remain existing builder_drafts; no mutable runtime latest alias is authority.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
