# File plan — `contracts/spec-038/workload-identity.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-038/workload-identity.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-038](../../docs/specs/spec-038.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0222](../../docs/tickets/zn-0222.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-038
AuthenticateEnterprise(assertion,connection) -> PresenceProof; ApplyDirectoryChange(connection,event) -> ProvisioningReceipt; ReconcileDirectory(connection,cut) -> Differences; MintWorkloadIdentity(scope) -> NarrowCredential.

door.enterprise_connections(connection_id PK,organization_ref,protocol,issuer,metadata_digest,state); door.directory_subjects(connection_id,external_id PK,principal_ref,version,active); ontology.directory_mappings(mapping_id PK,world_id,connection_id,group_ref,role_scope,release_ref); audit.provisioning_events(event_id PK,connection_id,provider_event_ref,state,receipt_ref). Workloads have distinct principals, not shared human sessions.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
