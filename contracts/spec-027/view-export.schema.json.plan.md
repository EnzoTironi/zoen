# File plan — `contracts/spec-027/view-export.schema.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `contracts/spec-027/view-export.schema.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-027](../../docs/specs/spec-027.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0162](../../docs/tickets/zn-0162.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL SCHEMA PLAN — no permissive {} schema or fabricated generated types.
RESOLVE exact input/output/tagged-error fields from the operation signatures and common protocol.
REQUIRE bounded sizes/depth/arrays, exact discriminants, validated IDs and explicit optional/null distinctions.
REJECT additional or authority-bearing client fields; money/counters stay strings where required.
GENERATE canonical fixtures, wire types and surface descriptors from this single reviewed schema source.
TEST malformed/oversized/unknown-version inputs and exact round trips; registry presence alone is not a pass.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-027
OpenFocus(focus,freshGrant) -> Historical|Newer|UnavailableView; RenderChart(chartDocument,frame) -> AccessibleView; ExportView(frame,format,destination) -> AuthorizedExportCase.

Presentation definitions: ViewDefinition, ChartDocument, TableDefinition and FocusLens. Instance preferences remain Eve-owned data. Frame/Focus refs are opaque; browser caches include current principal/World/security revision and are discarded on logout/rebind.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
