# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-039/durable-storage.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-039/durable-storage.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-039](../../../docs/specs/spec-039.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0226](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0226.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-039
ProvisionCell(profile,region,lock) -> StagedCell; AdmitCell(evidence) -> ActiveCell; RestoreCell(backup,ledger,profile) -> ReadOnlyCell; OpenPrivateConnector(profile) -> ScopedRoute.

Infrastructure state describes account/region/cell, authority database, object namespaces, KMS keys, private endpoints, workload identities, backup policy and admitted image digests. control.cells(cell_id PK,region,profile,epoch,admission_ref,state); audit.recovery_runs(run_id PK,cell_id,backup_ref,measured_rpo,measured_rto,evidence_ref). Customer content stays out of the directory/control plane.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
