# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-025/specialized-agent.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-025/specialized-agent.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-025](../../../docs/specs/spec-025.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0151](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0151.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-025
Search(query,grant,bounds) -> AuthorizedSearchFrame | UnsupportedPlan; RetrieveEvidence(resultRef,freshGrant) -> Evidence; StartSpecializedAgent(definition,parentMandate,task) -> BoundedAgentRun.

ontology.search_documents(document_id PK,world_id,evidence_ref,source_revision,projection_cut,rights_label,text_vector,embedding_ref); ontology.embedding_jobs(job_id PK,source_ref,model_profile,rights_basis,state); ontology.agent_definitions are released data, not unbounded executable loaders. Index records carry deletion/source ACL lineage.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
