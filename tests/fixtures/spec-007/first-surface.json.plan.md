# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-007/first-surface.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-007/first-surface.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-007](../../../docs/specs/spec-007.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0045](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0045.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-007
Inspect(operationId,input,purpose,expectedContract) -> WorldFrame; Explain(frameId,grant) -> Frame; OpenFrame(frameId,freshGrant) -> SameHistoricalFrame | NewerFrame | HistoricalContentUnavailable; Discover(grant) -> AllowedOperationManifest.

ontology.frames(frame_id PK,world_id,head_digest,cut_json,operation_id,plan_digest,perspective,rights_basis,payload_ref,created_at,expires_at); ontology.frame_pins(frame_id,evidence_or_snapshot_ref PK,retention_class). Opaque Focus records live in Eve, not here. Index frames by World and ID; no global public digest endpoint.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
