# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-032/watermarks.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-032/watermarks.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-032](../../../docs/specs/spec-032.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0189](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0189.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-032
RunFlow(definition,inputs) -> FlowRun; CheckpointPartition(run,partition,fence,cursor) -> Progress; EvaluateQuality(check,inputCoverage) -> pass|fail|unknown; ProposeFlowPublication(run) -> DatasetProposal | Blocked.

ontology.flow_definitions are released data; jobs.flow_runs(run_id PK,world_id,definition_digest,input_cut,state,attempt,budget_ref); jobs.flow_partitions(run_id,partition PK,cursor,watermark,gaps_json,fence,state); ontology.lineage_edges(output_ref,input_ref,field_mapping_digest PK); ontology.quality_results(result_id PK,run_id,check_id,status,coverage,details_ref).

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
