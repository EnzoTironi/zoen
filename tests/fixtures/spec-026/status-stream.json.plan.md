# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-026/status-stream.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-026/status-stream.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-026](../../../docs/specs/spec-026.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0157](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0157.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-026
Discover(world,purpose) -> AuthorizedManifest; Invoke(operationId,contractDigest,input,operationId?) -> Result; GenerateClient(manifest,target) -> ReproducibleClient; NegotiateProtocol(clientVersions) -> SelectedVersion | UnsupportedVersion.

No new authority tables. Generated contracts live in contracts/generated/<release-digest> and include operation IDs, input/output/error schemas, effect class, assurance, compatibility and manifest digest. Protocol edition and generated toolchain versions are separately admitted in execution-lock.json.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
