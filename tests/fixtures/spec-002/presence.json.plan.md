# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-002/presence.json`

**Status:** implementation-in-progress; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-002/presence.json`. Representation: **existing-with-sidecar**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-002](../../../docs/specs/spec-002.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0013](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0013.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

The adjacent implementation is preserved. Read it first, extend it in place, and prove behavior at the ticket's required layer. Do not replace it with this plan or create a duplicate primitive.

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-002
DoorPort.verify(assertion) -> PresenceProof; CreatePersonalWorld(operationId, seedDigest) -> GenesisReceipt; OpenWorld(worldId,purpose) -> GrantRef | Denied; AcceptInvitation(invitationToken,operationId) -> MembershipReceipt.

door.subject_map(subject_id PK, principal_id UNIQUE); ontology.worlds(world_id PK, realm, cell_id, epoch, release_digest, generation_id, security_revision, status); ontology.memberships(world_id,principal_id PK, role, status, revision); ontology.grants(grant_hash PK, world_id, principal_id, purpose, audience_hash, assurance, expires_at, security_revision, scope_json); ontology.invitations(invitation_hash PK, world_id, intended_subject, expires_at, consumed_by). Owner runtime role differs from migration owner.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
