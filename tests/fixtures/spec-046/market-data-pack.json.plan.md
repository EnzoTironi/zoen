# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-046/market-data-pack.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-046/market-data-pack.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-046](../../../docs/specs/spec-046.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0267](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0267.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-046
ValuePortfolio(portfolio,priceBasis,fxBasis,policy) -> ValuationFrame; EvaluateRisk(orderIntent,basis,limits) -> Pass|Fail|Unknown; InspectDepth(instrument,feedCut,grant) -> EntitledBook | Gapped; CaptureTradeBasis(ref,maxAge) -> EvidenceRef.

Released objects: Quote, Trade, OrderBookState, Position, CashBalance, Reservation, Portfolio, Benchmark, ValuationPolicy, RiskLimit and RiskObservation. Dense feeds use exact dataset/capture references; portfolio snapshots contain declared account coverage and adjustment/valuation policy.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
