# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-038/scim.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-038/scim.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-038](../../../docs/specs/spec-038.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0220](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0220.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-038
AuthenticateEnterprise(assertion,connection) -> PresenceProof; ApplyDirectoryChange(connection,event) -> ProvisioningReceipt; ReconcileDirectory(connection,cut) -> Differences; MintWorkloadIdentity(scope) -> NarrowCredential.

door.enterprise_connections(connection_id PK,organization_ref,protocol,issuer,metadata_digest,state); door.directory_subjects(connection_id,external_id PK,principal_ref,version,active); ontology.directory_mappings(mapping_id PK,world_id,connection_id,group_ref,role_scope,release_ref); audit.provisioning_events(event_id PK,connection_id,provider_event_ref,state,receipt_ref). Workloads have distinct principals, not shared human sessions.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
