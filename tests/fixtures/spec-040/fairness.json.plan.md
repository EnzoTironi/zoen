# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-040/fairness.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-040/fairness.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-040](../../../docs/specs/spec-040.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0231](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0231.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-040
ReserveUsage(world,resource,estimate) -> Reservation | QuotaExceeded; AdmitWorkload(profile,benchmarkReport) -> CapacityCertificate; RequestSupportAccess(scope,purpose) -> TimeBoundCase; ExportAudit(scope,destination) -> AuthorizedArtifact.

ontology.quota_policies(policy_id PK,world_id,resource,limit,window,priority); jobs.usage_reservations(reservation_id PK,world_id,kind,estimate,actual,state); audit.support_sessions(session_id PK,operator,world_scope,purpose,approver,expires_at,state); audit.slo_reports(report_id PK,profile,workload_digest,window,metrics,evidence_ref). Billing ledger references provider entitlements, never raw card data.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
