# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-022/approvals.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-022/approvals.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-022](../../../docs/specs/spec-022.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0131](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0131.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-022
ProposeAction(action,input,basis) -> ActionCase; AnswerCase(caseId,caseDigest,answer,operationId) -> CaseProgress | Receipt | Stale; CancelCase(caseId,operationId) -> State; CommitCase(caseId,digest) -> DecisionReceipt.

ontology.action_cases(case_id PK,world_id,revision,action_id,release_digest,basis_ref,intent_json,case_digest,consequences_digest,guards_json,expires_at,state); ontology.case_approvals(case_id,revision,principal_id PK,answer,case_digest,assurance,policy_basis,recorded_at); ontology.case_receipts(case_id,revision PK,receipt_id,commit_id). Normative states add cancelled and blocked to v2 representative type examples.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
