# File plan — `tests/fixtures/spec-021/clinic-definitions.json`

**Status:** planned; no product acceptance implied.

Target: `tests/fixtures/spec-021/clinic-definitions.json`. Representation: **sidecar-only**. Allocation: **conditional-support**.

Specs: [SPEC-021](../../../docs/specs/spec-021.md).
Tickets: [ZN-0124](../../../docs/tickets/zn-0124.md).

## Responsibility and reuse

```text
CONDITIONAL INPUT FIXTURE PLAN — not an observed service result.
USE synthetic records within owned disposable namespaces and explicit valid/knowledge time.
INCLUDE comparable rivals, a denied source, duplicate provenance family and stale dependency when in scope.
COMPUTE fixed expected values from the owning oracle, not from the implementation under test.
LOAD through the real component/journey boundary; do not replace provider/database behavior with this file.
VERSION seed, units, rights and cleanup scope.
```

## Owning state / operation contracts

### SPEC-021
InspectAvailability(scope,timeRange) -> AuthorizedSlots; ProposeReschedule(appointment,slot,basis) -> ActionCase when S4 admitted; InspectAdministrativePatient(subject,purpose) -> RestrictedFrame.

Released definitions: Clinic, Appointment, ProviderAvailability, Room, PatientAdministrativeIdentity, BillingReference and ClinicalRecordReference. Clinical payload rights do not inherit from appointment visibility. All instances use the common ontology storage and audited domain operations.

## Acceptance boundary

A plan is not implementation, and a compile of comment-only files proves no behavior. All relevant ticket check IDs must execute at their required layer with independent evidence. Services are not mocked; missing credentials/dependencies remain blockers.
